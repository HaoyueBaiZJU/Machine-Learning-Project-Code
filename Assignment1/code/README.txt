Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
COMP 5212: Machine Learning
Programming Assignment 1

Author: BAI Haoyue

Setting: Anaconda3; python3.6; scikit-learn 

Contain 6 files:
1: 1_logistic regression model.py
2: 2_single hidden layer nn model.py
3: 3_SVM with linear kernel.py
4: 4_SVM with RBF kernel.py
5: Programming Assignment 1 report.pdf
6: README.txt

Tasks:
1. use a logistic regression model for classification
2. use a single-hidden-layer neural network model for classification
3. use a support vector machine model for classification
4. conduct empirical study to compare several classification methods
5. a report

How to use:
step1: put the datasets(mouse.npz, pulsar_star.npz, wine.npz) in this folder
step2: edit datasetPath part to choose a certain data set for a Python file
step3: use python3.6 run the Python file
step4: wait for some time and will get experiment results
